Unity 2D Game, educational project for Coursera, C# Programming for Unity Game Development Specialization.

### Built with
- Unity
- C#

## Gameplay
The player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them.

The game spawns a new ball every few seconds, so there are regularly multiple balls in play at the same time. Each ball only stays alive for a certain period of time. When the time expires, the ball is destroyed.

The game keeps track of and displays the playerâ€™s score and the number of balls the player has left to lose.

### Block types
1. Standard - behaves in the normal way.
2. Bonus - counts for double points when hit by ball.
3. Freezer - makes the paddle unmovable for a short period of time.
4. Speedup - makes all balls in play move at twice their current speed for a short period of time.

### Menus
1. Main Menu - lets player pick play, help, or quit.
2. Help Menu - a single page that displays brief game instructions.
3. Pause Menu - a menu displayed if the player pauses a game, provides options to resume the game or quit to the main menu.

### Game is over
When the player has cleared all the blocks on a level, the game ends. The game also ends when the player loses the fifth ball. 

When the game ends, the game displays a message showing the player's final score, then returns to the Main Menu when the player clicks a Quit button.
